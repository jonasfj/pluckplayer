pluckplayer
==========

pluckplayer is a simple music player plugin for [pluck](pluck-cms.org), it uses XSPF Jukebox for playback and allows the user to make one playlist available. pluckplayer requires php5, however, spyc.php might be replacable with something that runs php4, feel free to contact me if you want to start such a branch.
